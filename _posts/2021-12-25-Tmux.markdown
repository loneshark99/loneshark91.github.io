Tmux is a terminal multiplexer and I use it in my day to day activities. I have installed the [Oh-My-Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux). This gives some great benefits. Oh-My-Tmux maps the CTRL+A as the trigger key. Default is CTRL+B.


Tmux has a client/server model, so you can detach and then later attach back to the same Tmux session. So you can continue working from where you left off. This is a great benefit.

` tmux new-session -s MySession `
` tmux detach-session MySession `
` tmux attach-session -t MySession `

You can create mutiple windows

` CTRL+A  C`  This creates a new window
` CTRL+A  ,` Rename the window
` CTRL+A 1` where 1 is the window number. This can be used to switch between windows

You can create mutiple panes

` CTRL+A % ` To split the window vertically
` CTRL+A " ` To split the window horizontally
` CTRL+A q ` To view the pane number
` CTRL+A arrow key ` To change between the panes

These are basically what I use. Tmux offers much more like different modes etc.

You can see tmux in action in this video.
