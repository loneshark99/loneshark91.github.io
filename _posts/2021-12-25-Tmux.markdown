Tmux is a terminal multiplexer and I use it in my day to day activities. I have installed the [Oh-My-Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux). This gives some great benefits. Oh-My-Tmux maps the CTRL+A as the trigger key. Default is CTRL+B.


Tmux has a client/server model, so you can detach and then later attach back to the same Tmux session. So you can continue working from where you left off. This is a great benefit.

```
    tmux new-session -s MySession 
    tmux detach-session MySession 
    tmux attach-session -t MySession 
```

You can create mutiple windows

| Operation | Command |
| --- | ----------- |
| Creates a new window | CTRL+A  C |
| To split the window horizontally | CTRL+A  , |
| To view the pane number | CTRL+A  1 |


You can create mutiple panes

| Operation | Command |
| --- | ----------- |
| To split the window vertically | CTRL+A % |
| To split the window horizontally | CTRL+A " |
| To view the pane number | CTRL+A q |
| To change between the panes | CTRL+A arrow key |


These are basically the commands I use. Tmux offers much more like different modes etc.

You can see tmux in action in this video.
