Jupyter notebook is a great tool to show/share your work. The tool also provides some ways to easily execute and take some actions on the results obtained. I didnt know about SList before and found it to be very useful to do some quick manipulations on the StdOut and StdError.

Take a look at this notebook to see the usefulness of SList.
