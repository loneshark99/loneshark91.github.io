Key Less SSH logins , use the following commands to create a Public/Private Key and copy the public key to the SSH server.

```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id yash@xx.xx.xx.xx
ssh yash@xx.xx.xx.xx
```

On a windows machine you wont have access to the script ssh-copy-id. In that case run the following commands.

```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh yash@192.168.0.14 "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
ssh yash@xx.xx.xx.xx
```

One thing to note here in the below command is why are we using double quotes infront of the cat command.

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh yash@192.168.0.14 "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

As we know, that double quotes only allows below expansion/substitution and does not allow tilde expansion. So the command will be run as is on the remote server.

- parameter expansion
- arithmetic expansion
- command substitution
