I am listing of thr visual studio useful shortcuts that I use frequently.

- My personal favorite is getting quickly to the solution explorer.
  > CTRL + ALT + L

- Fine next feature is very useful for me. I generally highlight a particular variable and then keep pressing F3 with CTRL pressed to find the other occurrences of the variable.
  > CTRL + F3

- Attach to a process is also one of my fvt command line shortcut
  > CTRL + ALT + P

- Another personal fvt of mine is to get suggestions or to add a missing using statement etc
  > CTRL + .

- Paste from the Clipboard, for example you want to paste something you copied a while ago.
  > CTRL + SHIFT + P

- For code formatting I use
  > CTRL + K + D

- For code commenting I use
  > CTRL + K + C

- For multi update one below the other I use
  > ALT + SHIFT + (Select the region using cursor)

- You are working on updating some code and now want to go to next line without using mouse or going to the end and then pressing ENTRE. You can use the below command which will drop you to a new line below the current line you are working on.
  > SHIFT + ENTER
  
- To debug a test without going to the Test explorer and then searching for the test. You can just navigate to the text and press
  > CTRL + R + T

- To get to the terminal in the Visual Studio I use
  > CTRL + `

- Output window in visual studio is one of my fvt windows in visual studio. To get to it 
  > CTRL + ALT + O

- While debugging I love to use the Quick Watch window, where I can play around with some variables etc. To get to the quick watch I use
  > CTRL + D + Q

- WHile debugging I sometimes like to see all the break points. For this I use the below shortcut.
  > CTRL + ALT + B

- While debugging I like to see the call stack, for this I use the below shortcut.
  > CTRL + ALT + C

- Sometimes in lambda expression you want to set breakpoint inside the implementation. For this I use
  > CTRL + F9

These are some of my shortcuts I use frequently with Visual Studio. I hope to keep updating the list as and when possible.
